Hi, I am a Frontend Developer based in India.

With over three years of experience, I have contributed to making projects more scalable and efficient, working mostly with startups. I primarily specialize in web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. I have also contributed to open-source projects. Currently, I’m sharpening my skills by learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).📚🔍

🚀 I am open to remote opportunities for frontend development projects.
